# js-projects #

A collection of mini-projects I worked on while learning JavaScript, and some scripts for practicing.

1. **practice**
    
    - create an annoying pop-up on a web-page
    - create a basic calculator
    
2. **earth-hour quiz-form**

    - fun quiz-form to assess basic general knowledge about the Earth Hour
    - correct answer choices can be viewed after submitting, along with an animated result percentage
    - cleaned up the UI for a more aesthetic look

3. **to-do app**

    - simple to-do list web-app, where you can add, delete, and search for your tasks.
    - minimalist UI via bootstrap5
    - dark mode enabled
  
4. **weather app**

    - web-app to check the weather conditions of different locations around the globe
    - uses the AccuWeather API to deliver precise information, quickly
    - uses local storage
 
5. **bucket-list app**

    - web-app to store different goals, add new ones, or remove the ones achieved
    - uses Firebase instead of local storage
    - clean, responsive UI
